- Test setup for Henzell queries:
  - Small logfile snapshot.
  - Load into test db
  - Run queries and check for expected results.

  -

Extended Henzell queries (joins, yay):

 - Games by players who have more than X wins:

   SELECT * FROM logrecord WHERE pname IN (
      SELECT pname FROM logrecord WHERE ktyp='winning' GROUP BY pname
      HAVING COUNT(*) > 3 );

   !lg * [[ * win s=name x=name :: count > 3 ]]

- Games that are first wins:
   SELECT * FROM logrecord a,
     (SELECT pname, MIN(starttime) FROM logrecord
      WHERE ktyp = 'winning' GROUP BY pname) b
   WHERE a.pname = b.name AND a.starttime = b.starttime

   !lg * [[ * win s=name x=name,min(start) ]] s=char

   Use: x= in subqueries to select join fields.

- Player who has the most combo highscores:

   Combo highscores: char, MAX(score) FROM logrecord GROUP BY char

   Players with combo highscores:
   SELECT name, COUNT(*) c FROM logrecord WHERE char = ch.char AND sc = ch.sc
   GROUP BY name ORDER BY c DESC

   !lg * [[ * s=char x=char,max(sc) ]] s=name

- Game with most Boris kills:
   !lg * [[ !lm * uniq=Boris s=game_id ]]
   (The implicit order by COUNT(*) is used here).

- Games with most milestones in Shoals:
   !lg * [[ !lm * Shoals s=game_id ]]

 Real query parser.

---------------------------------------------------

- Save query:
  !alias blarg !lg <xyz>
  !blarg <stuff> => !lg <xyz> +++ <stuff>
  !blarg is checked only if none of the existing commands match.
         Would be nice if !alias <keywords> could work.

  +++ operator to combine multiple arglists.
