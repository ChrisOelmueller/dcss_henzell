* Have greensnark add realtime, possibly also number of monsters in sight, to each where file.

* PM support.

* doy (probably also other people) milestone idea: when HP drops below a certain percent (say, 10%).. probably also a minimum level cap so the milestone file doesn't get too large.

* Message-leaving system needs some improvements before it can be called done
  - really needs PM support
  - limit of say, 5 messages
  - when we get a seendb, limit message-target to someone who is in the seendb
  - probably need to make sure the target is identified to nickserv as well
